<ul>
<li>A year from now you may wish you had started today.</li>
<li>The question isn’t who is going to let me; it’s who is going to stop me.</li>
<li>Success is the sum of small efforts, repeated day-in and day-out.</li>

<h3>Success is largely a matter of holding on after others have let go!</h3>
<ul>
<li>A year from now you may wish you had started today.</li>
<li>The question isn’t who is going to let me; it’s who is going to stop me.</li>
<li>Success is the sum of small efforts, repeated day-in and day-out.</li>
<li>I find that the harder I work, the more luck I seem to have.</li>
<li>If people did not do silly things, nothing intelligent would ever get done.</li>
<li>Before anything else, preparation is the key to success.</li>
</ul>
