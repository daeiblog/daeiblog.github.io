<li>The question isn’t who is going to let me; it’s who is going to stop me.</li>

<li>I find that the harder I work, the more luck I seem to have.</li>
<li>If people did not do silly things, nothing intelligent would ever get done.</li>
<li>Before anything else, preparation is the key to success.</li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t ever play yourself.
